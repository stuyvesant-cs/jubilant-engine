<div class="para">An IDE is just fancy talk for something you're already familiar with, since it is how you programmed in both NetLogo and Racket. An IDE is a computer program where you both write and run your code. When you used <em class="emphasis">DrRacket</em>, you would write your Racket code in the top pane, click <em class="emphasis">Run</em> and then see the result of your program in the bottom pane. The bottom pane also provided you with an interative console to test out small functions. If you want to use an IDE for Python, I highly suggest using <a class="external" href="https://thonny.org/" target="_blank">Thonny</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>, which provides an environment that will feel familiar. (Python also comes with its own IDE called Idle, which will be installed along with Python if you install from the main Python website.)</div>
